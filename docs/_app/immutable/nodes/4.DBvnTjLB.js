On their own, they are case-insensitive, meaning that an address written in all lowercase is identical to the same address in all uppercase or any mixed case. This flexibility, while convenient, introduces a significant risk: a single character typed incorrectly can result in funds being sent to a completely different address with no warning.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">EIP-55, introduced in 2016, addresses this problem by adding a checksum to Ethereum addresses through deliberate capitalization of certain letters. The capitalization pattern is derived from a hash of the address itself, making it possible to detect most typing errors automatically. If even one character is wrong or the capitalization does not match the computed checksum, the address is flagged as invalid.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Why EIP-55 Was Needed</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Before EIP-55, users relied entirely on careful copy-pasting or manual verification to avoid mistakes. Typos were common, especially when addresses were shared in text form or entered manually. A single flipped character could redirect transactions irreversibly. EIP-55 provides a lightweight, built-in mechanism to catch these errors without requiring additional infrastructure or changes to the protocol itself.</p> <h3 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Key Advantages</h3> <ul class="svelte-1tq17n3"><li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Detects single-character errors in most cases</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Catches incorrect capitalization that deviates from the checksum</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Requires no extra data or storage on the blockchain</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Compatible with existing lowercase or uppercase addresses</li></ul> <h3 class="svelte-1tq17n3">How Users Benefit</h3> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Any wallet, dApp, or tool that implements EIP-55 validation can immediately warn users when an address appears suspicious.
